# bracket.json Generator and Editor for osu! Lazer Tournament Client

Made by [rrailgun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10525148)

## Introduction

This script was originally made to make setting up the osu! Lazer Tournament Client easier for my osu! tournament [June Journament](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1912348). This is originally inspired by a similar script made by [DRCallaghan](https://github.com/DRCallaghan) named [osu! Lazer Tournament Client Bracket Generator CLI](https://github.com/DRCallaghan/osu-lazer-qualifier-results-bracket-generator).

This script aims to save time setting up and updating the bracket.json file by:
- Utilize bracket [templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nQCujQAnoeCRQVSa4w6sEfwiNvt0USm2) originally made by BCraftMG ranging from RO16SE to RO64DE
- Add teams with players from a `teams.tsv` file.
- Add seedings to the teams from a `seedings.tsv` file.
- Add qualifier statistics for each team from a `quals.tsv` file.
- Populate maps into any round of the tournament from a `beatmaps.tsv` file
- Utilize the imported seedings to create the initial matchups in the bracket
- Update the scores and match times for matches in a round from a `matches.tsv` file.

## Instructions
